# realloc函数的具体处理

## man文档：

The realloc() function tries to change the size of the allocation pointed
     to by ptr to size, and returns ptr.  If there is not enough room to
     enlarge the memory allocation pointed to by ptr, realloc() creates a new
     allocation, copies as much of the old data pointed to by ptr as will fit
     to the new allocation, **<u>frees the old allocation</u>**, and returns a pointer to
     the allocated memory.  If ptr is NULL, realloc() is identical to a call
     to malloc() for size bytes.  If size is zero and ptr is not NULL, a new,
     minimum sized object is allocated and the original object is freed.  When
     extending a region allocated with calloc(3), realloc(3) does not guaran-
     tee that the additional memory is also zero-filled.

在原有内存之后没有多余内存, 并在其他位置分配成功后, 会free掉原有内存
